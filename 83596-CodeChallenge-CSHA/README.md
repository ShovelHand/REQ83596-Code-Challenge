# 83596-CodeChallenge-CSHA

This application is for the REQ83596 Code Challenge

##Installation
This project requires NodeJS to be installed, and that npm commands can be run. 
####To run locally:
-Clone the repo
-Navigate to the root folder
-Install the packages with ```npm install packages```
-Run Webpack ```node_modules/.bin/webpack ./app.tsx --config webpack-config.js```
-Start the server ```Node server.js```

####Set your browser to https://localhost:3000 to use the application.

##Testing
Unfortunately I did not get far with testing, and there is only one basic Jest test. I'll see if I can get some more meaningful tests in by noon, but Jest has presented a significant learning curve for me. 
To run test(s) type ```npm tests``` on the command line in the root directory.
